# WoodSKE
**An algorithm to extract skeletons from discrete point clouds of tree branches collected by terrestrial laser scanners.**<br>
     We developed the WoodSKE method to extract `skeletons` from discrete point clouds of tree branches collected by `terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs).` A TLS point cloud of tree branches is firstly contracted according to the pointwise local point distribution pattern to extract its `coarse skeleton.` Then, the coarse skeleton is thinned and optimized by a noise-filtering method.<br>
