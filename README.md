**ABSTRACT**<br>
     This study developed the WoodSKE method to extract skeletons from discrete point clouds of tree branches collected by terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) for assessing their IAs. A TLS point cloud of tree branches was firstly contracted according to the pointwise local point distribution pattern to extract its coarse skeleton. Then, the coarse skeleton would be thinned and optimized by a noise-filtering method. The IAs of tree branches were estimated based on their skeleton distribution.
